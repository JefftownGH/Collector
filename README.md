# iLogicCollector
An Inventor iLogic tool that compiles multiple Visual Basic files into a single file.  This file can be run from inside Inventor's iLogic environment.  This is most useful when you want to code in an external IDE such as Visual Studio, or when working on an add-in that you want to perform quick testing on during development.
